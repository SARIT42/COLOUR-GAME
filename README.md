In each try, the user gets 30 seconds and has to guess as many colours as he can within that time. The words would be the names of the different colours and they would be each written in a different colour chosen randomly by the system. The user has to GUESS THE COLOUR IN WHICH THE WORD IS WRIITEN.

For each CORRECT guess, the user gets a +2 POINTS. For each WRONG / MISSED guess, the user gets a -2 POINTS.


The final score is showed after the 30 seconds time has run out.
