# COLOUR-GAME (STROOP EFFECT)
This a simple Python-GUI game of guessing the colour of the words showing up on the screen one after the another. THIS IS CALLED THE STROOP EFFECT.
In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli.

The effect has been used to create a psychological test (the Stroop test) that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.

A basic task that demonstrates this effect occurs when there is a mismatch between the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") and the color it is printed on (i.e., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink). When asked to name the color of the word it takes longer and is more prone to errors when the color of the ink does not match the name of the color.

In each try, the user gets 30 seconds and has to guess as many colours as he can within that time. The words would be the names of the different colours and they would be each written in a different colour chosen randomly by the system. The user has to GUESS THE COLOUR IN WHICH THE WORD IS WRIITEN.

For each CORRECT guess, the user gets a +2 POINTS. For each WRONG / MISSED guess, the user gets a -2 POINTS.


The final score is showed after the 30 seconds time has run out.
